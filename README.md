## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Multi-Currency Support**: Accept payments in SOL, USDC, and USDT
- **Flexible Vesting**: Two vesting types - Immediate and Linear
- **Admin Controls**: Comprehensive administrative functions
- **Whitelist Management**: Manual investor whitelisting by admin
- **Token Claims**: Automated vesting-based token distribution
- **Treasury Management**: Separate treasuries for each accepted currency

### Vesting Types

#### 1. Immediate Vesting (Type 0)
- **TGE Release**: 10% of tokens released immediately at Token Generation Event
- **Linear Vesting**: Remaining 90% vested daily over 365 days
- **Formula**: Daily release = (Total Allocation ร 0.9) รท 365

#### 2. Linear Vesting (Type 1) - Milestone-Based
- **TGE**: 5% released immediately
- **8 Months**: Additional 10% (Total: 15%)
- **18 Months**: Additional 20% (Total: 35%)
- **24 Months**: Additional 20% (Total: 55%)
- **36 Months**: Remaining 45% (Total: 100%)

#### 3. Administrative Controls
- `set_ico_dates()` - Update ICO start/end times
- `set_tge_date()` - Update token generation event time
- `set_paused()` - Emergency pause/unpause
- `remove_investor()` - Remove investor and reclaim allocation
- `block_investor()` - Block investor from claiming
- `transfer_ownership()` - Transfer program authority
- `renounce_ownership()` - Renounce program authority

### Query Functions

- `get_ico_dates()` - Retrieve ICO timing information
- `get_token_rate()` - Get current exchange rates
- `get_min_max_buy_amount()` - Get purchase limits
- `get_vesting_balance()` - Check investor's vesting status
- `get_linear_vesting_end_time()` - Get linear vesting milestones
- `determine_claimable_tokens()` - Calculate claimable amount


## Security Features

1. **Authority Checks**: All admin functions require proper authority validation
2. **Time-based Controls**: ICO phases and vesting schedules are time-locked
3. **Overflow Protection**: All arithmetic operations include overflow checks
4. **Account Validation**: Strict account ownership and type validation
5. **Emergency Pause**: Admin can pause all ICO operations
6. **Investor Blocking**: Admin can block malicious investors
